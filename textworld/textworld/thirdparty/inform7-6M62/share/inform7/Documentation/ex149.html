<p class="sectionheading">§19.9. Basis of a rulebook</p>
<p>Every rulebook works on a value supplied to it, though it doesn't always look that way. The kind of the value is called its &quot;basis&quot;; for example, if a rulebook works on a number, it's called a &quot;number based rulebook&quot;. Most of the rulebooks seen up to now have been action based rulebooks:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1615" -->
<a id="c1615"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of eating the cake: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;Instead&quot; is an action based rulebook, and the action it works on is the one currently being processed. Besides before, after and instead, other action based rulebooks include the check, carry out, and report rules; general rulebooks such as every turn rules, the visibility rules, the turn sequence rules; and rules specially for dealing with the actions of other characters, such as the persuasion and unsuccessful attempt rules. But we have also seen object based rulebooks:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1616" -->
<a id="c1616"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for reaching inside the flask: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;Reaching inside&quot; is an object based rulebook, and here we're giving it a rule which applies if the object is the flask. Inform would reject something like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1617" -->
<a id="c1617"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for reaching inside 100: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because 100 has the wrong kind to fit - it's a number, not an object. There are many object based rulebooks, because most activities built-in to Inform act on objects. For example, the &quot;printing the name of&quot; activity has three rulebooks attached to it: before printing the name of, for printing the name of, after printing the name of. All of these are object based rulebooks.</p>
<p>Finally, we've also seen scene based rulebooks (which is how rules like &quot;when a recurring scene ends&quot; worked, in the Scenes chapter).</p>
<p>If a rulebook is declared like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1618" -->
<a id="c1618"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Marvellous reasoning is a rulebook.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then it is an action based rulebook. If we want something different, we must write something like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1619" -->
<a id="c1619"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Grading is a number based rulebook.
<br />Grading 5: say &quot;It's five. What can I say?&quot; instead.
<br />Grading an odd number (called N): say &quot;There's something odd about [N].&quot; instead.
<br />Grading a number (called N): say &quot;Just [N].&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1620" -->
<a id="c1620"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins:
<br />repeat with N running from 1 to 10:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Grading [N]: &quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;follow the grading rulebook for N.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which produces:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1621" -->
<a id="c1621"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Grading 1: There's something odd about 1.
<br />Grading 2: Just 2.
<br />Grading 3: There's something odd about 3.
<br />Grading 4: Just 4.
<br />Grading 5: It's five. What can I say?
<br />Grading 6: Just 6.
<br />Grading 7: There's something odd about 7.
<br />Grading 8: Just 8.
<br />Grading 9: There's something odd about 9.
<br />Grading 10: Just 10.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here we needed a variation on &quot;follow&quot; which supplies the value to apply to:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn274" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn274"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>follow </b>(values based rule producing values)<b> for </b>(value)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_followfor -->

<p>This phrase causes the rule to be obeyed immediately (rather than simply at predetermined times such as when a particular action is being tried, or at the end of every turn, and such), and applies it to the value given, which must be of a matching kind. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1622" -->
<a id="c1622"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
follow the reaching inside rulebook for the electrified cage;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>And here is an example based on objects:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1623" -->
<a id="c1623"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The flotation rules are an object based rulebook.
<br />A flotation rule for the cork: rule succeeds.
<br />A flotation rule for an inflated thing: rule succeeds.
<br />A flotation rule: rule fails.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And we might use the flotation rules in a circumstance like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1624" -->
<a id="c1624"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After inserting something into the well:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;follow the flotation rules for the noun;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the rule succeeded:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The noun] bobs on the surface.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the noun is nowhere;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The noun] sinks out of sight.&quot;
</p></blockquote>

<p>As we recall from the chapter on activities, &quot;writing a paragraph about...&quot; is an activity; activities are themselves structured as sets of object-based rulebooks. The activity &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot; uses three object-based rulebooks (before writing..., for writing..., after writing...). We could have made a flotation activity as well, but in general it is overkill to make an activity to make success/failure decisions. For that purpose an object-based rulebook is sufficient.</p>
